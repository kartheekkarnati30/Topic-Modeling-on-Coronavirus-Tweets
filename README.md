# Topic-Modeling-on-Coronavirus-Tweets

Data Collection and preprocessing:

1. Collected tweets from various news sites in the US using the Twitter API and Tweepy querying by username and also collected tweets from various users in the US querying by text
containing key words like 'coronavirus', 'covid-19', 'COVID-19', 'pandemic' etc.

2. Preprocessed these tweets by removing URLs, emojis, punctuation and stop words. Converted text to lower case and also got the stemmed and lemmzatized version of tweets.

Ideas for the project:
1. How are news sites reporting about the pandemic? Key differences in reporting by sites like CNN and NBC compared to Fox and Breitbart.

2. Topic modeling on all tweets by news sites and on tweets by new sites pertaining to coronavirus.

3. How is the public handling the pandemic on Twitter? There was a debate on 22nd Oct, 2020. I collected tweets both before and after the debate to see how public opinion differed .
4. Topic modeling on tweets by public to see if I get a good separation in clusters of topics and the tokens in them.
